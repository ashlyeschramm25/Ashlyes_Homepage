    <h2> J.R. Carpenter "Handmade Web"</h2>
        <p>Reading about how Carpenter uses the word "handmade" very loosely and expresses how, although handmade usually means done physically, they are specifically talking about the web when it was hand coded, instead of made through a software. I find it very interesting how Carpenter talks about the archives of the web are still in the same format as they were created, unlike manuscripts or photographs. These items were created elsewhere and were transported to the area they are at today. As the web beagan to change, the web began losing the personal affect of the websites. I find this fascinating as although we believe we are bettering ourselves and inventions, we are losing all human emotions from these websites.   </p>
