    <h2> J.R. Carpenter "Handmade Web"</h2>
        <p>Reading about how Carpenter uses the word "handmade" very loosely and expresses how, although handmade usually means done physically, they are specifically talking about the web when it was hand coded, instead of made through a software. I find it very interesting how Carpenter talks about the archives of the web are still in the same format as they were created, unlike manuscripts or photographs. These items were created elsewhere and were transported to the area they are at today. As the web beagan to change, the web began losing the personal affect of the websites. I find this fascinating as although we believe we are bettering ourselves and inventions, we are losing all human emotions from these websites.   </p>
    <h2>Taeyoon Choi "Hello World!" </h2>
        <p>The format with doodles created a nice break between the paragraphs. The paraggraphs were confusing to understand and I had a hard time grasping the information, but having the pictures helped me visualize what the text was talking about. It was interesting to see the designs as multiple versions compared to each other. I believe the water color aspect of the essay was interesting as it's harder to control and a more messy medium rather than pens or pencils. I enjoyed the contrast between the structured text and the water colored illustrations. </p>
    <h2>Callum Copley "A Friend Is Writing"</h2>
        <p>Watching this website was extremely overwhelming. When I first opened the page up I was not expecting all of the notifications and texts popping up on the side. I was very confused on how I was supposed to read this website. I ended up letting it fully play out and then reading it as I couldn't read while the notifications were popping up because it was too distracting. In the sychronous exchanges, it is interesting to think about how text really is seen more as speaking rather than writing. The informality of text is a very strange concept. Thinking about the Mute Conversation, I never really thought about how we have different personas depending on who we are texting. At the same moment in time, I could be texting my boss formally, my friends about something humorous, and classmates about an assignment. All of these are a different part of my personality and it is interesting to think about how although they are happening at the same time by the same person, it is a "different person" talking in each chat.</p>

        <h2>Becca Abbe "The Internet's Back-to-the-land Movement"</h2>
        <p> Thinking the way that there is no cloud, just on someone else's computer is honestly a little scary to me. Although we think that these are just stored in "a cloud" but in reality our information and things are stored in someone else's computer and they are able to access all of our information. Although the physical world may seem like they have more contraints than the online world, I feel as though they are about the same. The online world is more capable of hiding the ability to observe what people are doing on the internet. In the physical world, when someone is watching you sign a check or fill something out, you know exactly what you are signing to do, but on the online world it is more unknown.   </p>
        <h2>Frank Chimero "The Good Room"</h2>
        <p>When Chimero stated "technology has transformed from a tool that we use to a place where we live" it really opened my eyes. The internet used to be this thing where one would go to look up something that they weren't sure about instead of using an encyclopedia, but now it has turned into this thing where everyone stays and uses it for unnecessary things. As he begins to talk about how everything costs on the internet now a days, and walking into a library almost feels illegal because they do not ask anything of you is very true. Also, having such a fast paced life and everyone is rushing to the next thing, it is weird seeing people sit and actually take a breath while reading books, or studying, or creating visa applications with their families. On the internet, everything costs or has wealth to it no matter what you are looking at. Anything that has any meaning or is to help a person with a problem, you have to pay for it. Even Instagram posts by celebrities get paid by the amount of likes they recieve on a post.  </p>
    

    <h2>Mindy Seu, The Poetry of Tools</h2>
        <p>The project that I chose to respond to was Sebastian Ly Serena's site. I found it interesting how she went through and dalthough the page is interactive in a way, the viewer physically cannot mess with the website. The format of this website reminds me of a domino effect. The way one thing leads to another is a very creative way to get somebody's email address. I do believe that allowing the viewer to mess with the website and seeing if their way could mess with how the sequence goes would be a cool concept to think about. I sat and watched this website multiple times just because it is so intriguing to witness. Thinking about all the codes and transitions that were put into this website is insane to me. </p>
