    <h2> J.R. Carpenter "Handmade Web"</h2>
        <p>Reading about how Carpenter uses the word "handmade" very loosely and expresses how, although handmade usually means done physically, they are specifically talking about the web when it was hand coded, instead of made through a software. I find it very interesting how Carpenter talks about the archives of the web are still in the same format as they were created, unlike manuscripts or photographs. These items were created elsewhere and were transported to the area they are at today. As the web beagan to change, the web began losing the personal affect of the websites. I find this fascinating as although we believe we are bettering ourselves and inventions, we are losing all human emotions from these websites.   </p>
    <h2>Taeyoon Choi "Hello World!" </h2>
        <p>The format with doodles created a nice break between the paragraphs. The paraggraphs were confusing to understand and I had a hard time grasping the information, but having the pictures helped me visualize what the text was talking about. It was interesting to see the designs as multiple versions compared to each other. I believe the water color aspect of the essay was interesting as it's harder to control and a more messy medium rather than pens or pencils. I enjoyed the contrast between the structured text and the water colored illustrations. </p>
    <h2>Callum Copley "A Friend Is Writing"</h2>
        <p>Watching this website was extremely overwhelming. When I first opened the page up I was not expecting all of the notifications and texts popping up on the side. I was very confused on how I was supposed to read this website. I ended up letting it fully play out and then reading it as I couldn't read while the notifications were popping up because it was too distracting. In the sychronous exchanges, it is interesting to think about how text really is seen more as speaking rather than writing. The informality of text is a very strange concept. Thinking about the Mute Conversation, I never really thought about how we have different personas depending on who we are texting. At the same moment in time, I could be texting my boss formally, my friends about something humorous, and classmates about an assignment. All of these are a different part of my personality and it is interesting to think about how although they are happening at the same time by the same person, it is a "different person" talking in each chat.</p>
